Desciption of the role of statistics in cosmology

The galaxy bispectrum is the Fourier-space equivalent of the three-point function and is as such the first of the higher-order statistics beyond the power spectrum. Next-generation large scale structure such as Euclid (galaxy) and the SKA (21cm intensity mapping) will rely on a combination of the power spectrum and the bispectrum for high-precision measurements of primordial non-Gaussianity and for improvement of constraints on cosmological parameters. In particular, improvement on constraints on the primordial non-Gaussian parameter $\fnl$ will be crucial for discrimitation between various models of inflation and other theories of the early universe. 

As it stands, our current understanding of the universe is that large scale structure of matter is a result of the growth of small primordial fluctuations which have functioned as seeds for structure growth in an otherwise homogeneous universe. These small fluctuations have been amplified by gravitatational instability, resulting in the formation of the structure that we know as the cosmic web on cosmological scales. Tests of theories describing these primordial fluctuations are statistical in nature for the following reasons. For one, there is no direct observationa access to primordial fluctuations, and additionally, the time-scales required to follow cosmological evolution of systems is much much longer than that over which observations are realistically possible. In essence this means that observations on the past lightcone how different objects at different phases of their evolution, and as a result tests of the evolution of large scale structure must be carried out statistically. 

A goal of theoretical cosmology is to make statistical predictions which depend on the statistical properties of primordial perturbations, which in turn lead to the formation of large scale structures in the universe. In these models, the observable universe is modelled simply as a stochastic realisation of a statistical ensemble of possibilities. The most widely considered models are based on the inflationary paradism, and generically give rise to adiabatic Gaussian initial fluctuations. In this case, the origin of stochasticity lies in quantum fluctuations that were generated in the early universe. 

\section{The two-point function}

A purely Gaussian field is fully described by the two-point correlation function or power spectrum. The two-point correlation function is defined as the joint ensemble average of the density at two different points $\x$ and $\x + \textbf{r}$, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
	\xi(r) = \langle \delta(\x) \delta(\x + \textbf{r}) \rangle,
\end{equation}
which is dependent on the distance $r$ between the two points only, due to statistical homogeneity and isotropy which are assumed throughout. Usually, the density contrast $\delta$ is expressed in terms of its Fourier space components, where our Fourier convention is 

\begin{equation}
	\delta{\x} = \int \diff^3k \, e^{\i \k \cdot \x } \delta(\x),
\end{equation}
where $\delta(\k)$ are complex random variables. Since the density contrast is real, this means that we have
\begin{equation}
	\delta(k) = \delta^*(-\k).
\end{equation}

Similarly, the correlators can also be computed in Fourier space, as follows, 
\begin{equation}
	\langle \delta(\k) \delta(\k') \rangle = \int 
\end{equation}
check fourier convention
