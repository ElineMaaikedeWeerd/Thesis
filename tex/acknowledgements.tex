This thesis would not have been possible without the support, encouragement, and guidance of my supervisor, Chris Clarkson. I am grateful for his time, patience with me as I stumbled my way through this PhD-- I know it hasn't always been easy. Thanks for not losing confidence in me, even when I lost mine. I would also express my deepest gratitude to Roy Maartens, for his guidance, sharing his expertise with me, and hosting me in Cape Town. I feel privileged having been able to spend time working in such an incredible environment.

Thanks to Alkistis Pourtsidou, for always listening and keeping me grounded, especially while writing this thesis; Phil Bull, for the many discussions about research, academia, and other, Tim Clifton, for his patience and advice; Richard Nelson, for encouragement and when I needed it; and all other lecturers and researchers in the Astronomy Unit, for making it such a great group to be part of. Finishing a PhD during a pandemic has been an experience: I thank Julian Adamek and Dan Thomas for online (and some outdoor) social hangouts.

The work presented here would not have been possible without my fantastic collaborators, who taught me so much: Stefano Camera, Sheean Jolicoeur, and Obinna Umeh. I thank Z\'e Fonseca for advice on coding and life-- I promise I will be better at Python, doubt myself less, in the future. 

My fellow PhD students past and present-- who have made being at Queen Mary so memorable-- thank you! Special thanks to John Ronayne for expertly taping bits of paper back together, Pedro Carrilho, for patiently answering all my ignorant questions about cosmology. My fellow cosmologists: Louis Coates, Jessie Durk, Fraser Kennedy, Charlie Pittordis, Shailee Imrith, Jorge Fuentes, Kit Gallagher, Paula Soares, Theo Anton, Rebecca Carrillo; and the non-cosmologists: Clark Baker, Domenico Trotta, Paul Hallam, John Strachan, Sanson Poon, Alice Giroul, Francesco Lovascio, Jack Skinner, Sandy Zeng. Sanson, I apologise for turning the office into a jungle with a fly infestation-- despite my best efforts it is evident that I don't have green fingers. Callum, Rebeca, Francesco-- we made it!

My friends near and far-- my Edinburgh friends, especially Ben Cullen for always interesting discussions, and Nicolas Angelides for always being fabulous. Thanks to David Grabner for listening, helping out and all the good times, Lisa van Son, for always being there for me and coming to see me in every place I have lived, and Sergio Vargas for being supportive and performing Mathematica magic whenever I got stuck.

Thanks to the GS gang (the non-violent kind of gang) for keeping me somewhat sane when the pandemic hit. 

Finally, I am grateful for my family-- thanks to my wonderful parents and brother for supporting me, and welcoming me back with open arms when I tried to escape from plague island. And Fran, thanks for helping me get myself together, when I thought this thesis madness would never end. Thank you all for putting up with me, much love for you all.
