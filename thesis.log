You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\rm' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\rm', e.g., by `\mathrm `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\rm' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\mathrm '.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\rm' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\rm', e.g., by `\mathrm `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\rm' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\mathrm '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

You should note that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a new font selection scheme
called NFSS2 with several new, combinable font commands. KOMA-Script
classes had defined the old font commands like `\rm' only for compatibility
with old LaTeX 2.09 document styles of Script 2.0. Nevertheless, these
commands are deprecated and undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013
KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of these deprecated commands.
Now, after two decades of LaTeX2e and NFSS2, these commands will not work any
more. If loading a package results in this error message, you should contact
the author of that package and ask him to replace the deprecated font command
`\rm', e.g., by `\mathrm `. Otherwise you should reconfigure
or replace the package. If you have used the old font command `\rm' yourself,
you should replace it, e.g., by `\mathrm '.
To make it work for now, you can use the already also deprecated class option
`enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.

you forgot something else, as in `\hbox{$x}'. In such cases
