\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces The absolute value of the bispectrum dipole at $z=1$ as a function of triangle size, in the flattened (Left, $\theta =2^\circ $, for intensity mapping bias) and squeezed (Right, $\theta =178^\circ $, for Euclid-like bias) configurations, with $k_3$ as the horizontal axis. Red is the $m=0$ part and blue is $m=\pm 1$. Dashed (and dotted) lines show up to the $O(\mathcal {H}/k)$ terms considered analytically here, while solid lines indicate larger-scale contributions. For reference the monopole is in black, with the dotted line the Newtonian part. (The zero-crossing in the monopole for the squeezed case is a result of the tidal bias.)}}{7}{figure.1.1}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.2}{\ignorespaces (Left) We show the dipoles as a function of $\theta $ with a bias appropriate for a Euclid-like survey, for $k_1=k_2=0.01$\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}Mpc$^{-1}$. The left of the plot corresponds to the flattened case where the $m=0$ (red) dipole reaches 10\% of the monopole. (Right) We show the IM signal with $k_1=k_2=0.1$\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}Mpc$^{-1}$ versus the long mode $k_3$. Except for very long modes $\theta \approx \pi $, our $O(\mathcal {H}/k)$ truncation is a very good approximation in these examples. }}{8}{figure.1.2}%
